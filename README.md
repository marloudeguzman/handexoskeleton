# handexoskeleton
Created an exoskeleton for a hand with Victor Fernandez-Kim for our Assistive Robotics Project
The project was to design and create an exoskeleton to allow for someone with a weak hand grip to better grip objects. We used a combination of high-torque motors, 100-lb tensile strength fishing wire, 3D printed rings, and an Arduino Mega.
